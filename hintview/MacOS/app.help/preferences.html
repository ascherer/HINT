    <p>
    The preferences pane allows persistent of the following settings.
    The Hintview application will cache the settings and may update the user preferces database
    at a later time. The settings are saved when the application is closed and take
    effect when the next instance of Hintview is started. If multiple instances of the Hintview
    application are running, the effect of changing settings in multiple instances of
    the preferences pane may lead to unexpected behaviour. Most of the time, the application that
    terminates last will overwrite settings of applications terminating earlier.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Start on Home Page</b><br>
            Open a new document on the "home" page. The home page is a location specified by
            the document author as a good starting point for reading the document.
            If not set, a new document is opened on the first page of the document.
            <p>
            See also the <b>&#8984;H</b> and the <b>Home</b> key.
            <p>
        <li><b>Start with Autoreload enabled</b><br>
            If in autoreload mode, the  viewer  will  reload
            the displayed HINT file each time the cursor enters the window.
            The viewer attempts to position the new file at about the same position as the old
            file. This attempt might fail if large scale changes have  been  made  to  the
            file.
            <p>
            See also the <b>&#8984;A</b> and <b>&#8984;R</b>  key.
            <p>
        
        <li><b>Start with Search Field shown</b><br>
            To enter a search text, the Hintviewer can display a Search Field as part of
            the window header. Because this reduces the space available for displaying
            the document, it is shown only on request.
            <p>
            See also the <b>&#8984;F</b> key.
            <p>
        <li><b>Open Files in new Window</b><br>
            The code of Hintview reuses large parts of the TeX typesetting engine
            which was written in the1980's.
            As a consequence, it can not handle multiple documents
            using the same window. So a new document will either replace the current
            document or it will require a new window.
            Currently dragging a file onto the Hintviewer will always replace the existing
            document while opening a file by doubble clicking it or opening it using
            the File - Open ... menu entry will open a new window if this is setting is
            enabled. Using the <b>&#8984;O</b> key is equivalent to using the Menu.
            <p>
        <li><b>Gamma</b><br>
            Generating the fonts used to display the documents uses (in most cases) a
            technique called "anti-aliasing". Pixels that are outside the boundary curve
            of a letter (technically called a glyph) are usualy white and inside they are
            black. But if the pixel is neither completely inside nor competely outside, because
            the boundary curve runs straight through the pixel, it gets a grey color
            according to the relation of the black area to the white area of the pixel.
            <p>
            The human perception of darkness is, however, not a linear function of
            of this black to white relation. Therefore the grey value of the
            pixel that is perceived by the human eye is computed from the black to white
            ratio using a special "gamma-function". The parameter for this function,
            the gamma value, can be adjusted with a slider.
            <p>
            But don't worry about all this
            theory. Changing the slider will immediatly adjust the appearance of the
            document. So just move the slider to a position where you like the
            documents appearance best. Good gamma values are usually between 1.8 and 2.2
            but they depend to a lage part on your monitor and personal taste.
            To fine tune the gamma setting, you can use the Left or Right Arrow keys
            to decrement or increment the gamma vale in steps of 0.01 (or 0.1 if the
            Shift key is pressed simultaneously).
            <p>

    Persistent settings that are not determined by the settings in this window:
    <ul>
        <li>Night mode</b><br>
            You can select beween night and day mode using the View menu or the <b>&#8984;N</b> key.
    This choce is made persistent when the viewer window is closed.
    So the next Hintview window you open will be opened in the current mode.
        <p>
        <li>Zoom factor</b><br>
            You can adjust the current zoom factor by dragging with the mouse
    in the top-left to bottom-right direction. You can reset the zoom
    factor using the View menu or the <b>&#8984;Z</b> key.
    This choce is made persistent when the viewer window is closed.
    So the next Hintview window you open will be opened with the current zoom factor.
