Interaction of grouping with paragraphs:

% Example 1:
% Color change is local to paragraph. The end of the group is ignored.
% This example is probably OK. No one should need to write such code.

Black { \color{blue} Blue

Blue } Black

%Example 2:
% When the group starts TeX is in vertical mode.
% The color change is part of the vertical list.
% Then end of the group is inside the paragraph and
% The \HINTendcolor will not find a color change in the
% paragraph to pop. So its ignored.
% The following paragraph is still blue.
% This is unfortunate!

{\color{blue} Blue} Black

Black


% Back to black.
\color{black}

% Example 3:
% This version works. The \indent puts TeX into horizontal mode
% and starts the paragraph before starting the group and changing
% the color.
\indent {\color{blue} Blue} Black

Black
